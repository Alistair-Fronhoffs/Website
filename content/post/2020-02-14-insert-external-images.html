<p>Sidestep: Including external images
I need to include some screenshots and this should be easy peasy, but I have spent quite some time wrestling with this. Up untill then I was knitting the posts <code>.rmd</code> file, to check it’s html output. However inserting the image gave me an error (“file not found”). Because I’ve got this <code>.rdm</code> file in the website folder as a new post, I don’t have to knit it anymore but check the post in my Viewer where it is automatically updated every time I save the file ::smiley::<br></p>
<p>So, just to show you, <strong>blogdown</strong> comes with addins, and I just had to choose “insert Image” in the addins menu.<br>
It will insert code in the form of:<br>
<code>![alternative text](path to file, starting from your /static folder)</code><br>
<strong>Blogdown</strong> assumes the path is stated from your <code>static</code> folder
<img src="/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/blogdown_addin_image.png" alt="addin insert image" />
Or through Tools &gt; Addins &gt; Browse Addins:<br></p>
<p><img src="/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/tools_addins*.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="tools &gt; addins &gt; browse addins" />
And then click the ‘Insert Image’ addin:
<img src="/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/Addins_chooser.png" style="width:70.0%" alt="Addin Chooser" /></p>
<p>Another possibility is using knitr’s function<br> <code>knitr::include_graphics()</code><br>
The basic form would be <br><code>knitr::include_graphics(file to path starting from \static\)</code></p>
<p>I heavily relied on Alison Presmanes Hill’s minimal <a href="https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/10/06/adding-figures-and-other-images-to-posts/">blogdown website</a>, so do check it out for more information !</p>
