# Why ?

Well, we've got a project, and would like to not only do it for ourselves but also share and showcase it !

A number of steps are therefore:

- Work to be done at the project (quite logical :wink:)
    - Essentially in R, but Python and QGIS will probably be used also
    - Using GitHub, Bitbucket,...to better collaborate 
- Document the work done
    - Why not use RMarkdown ?
- Publish the documentation (not all at once)
- Publish the results, steps, parts of them
    - A website would be cool !

# Where to start ?

Well, that's a good question, the project seems like a good start. But working on the project means to document it, and then...Git and a Website.
So, I started a couple of days ago, reading the [blogdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/#) and watching some tutorials about RMarkdown (like  [this one on Linkedinlearn](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/creating-reports-and-presentations-with-r-markdown-and-rstudio/next-steps)). I also found the [RMarkdown book](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/). The [bookdown](https://bookdown.org) site is really a good place with plenty of usefull information :smiley:

So getting stuff on GitHub looks like a first step, and therefore installing GIT on our computer needs to be done also.

## Getting to know GIT better
I have GIT installed already, but not configured in R. Also, I was not totally friends with GIT, so I found [this Happy Git with R book](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html#hello-git). And started at chapter 6, just to test that everything was fine:

```{bash whichgit}
which git
```

and 
```{bash gitversion}
git --version
```
at the time of writing it gave me 
git version 2.17.1

I followed their advise and configured git editor to use Geany (in case something goes wrong).
```{bash gitconfig&editor, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
git config --global core.editor "geany"
```

## Moving on to connect with GitHub
I already have a GitHub account, if you haven't it's quick and easy to [create one](www.github.com).<br>

Install a GIT-client as explained in [Chapter 8](https://happygitwithr.com/git-client.html). Because I'm on a Linux machine, I installed the recommended [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) GIT-client. I played around a little and made a repo on GitHub through it. It all seems fine, but there's a small catch, if you want to keep using the free version you can only use it fully with public repo's. 
You can still use it to create a private repo, this might be an advantage if you want to do it from the app and not having to hop over to GitHub.

Creating a repo, testing the connection, committing and pushing with the command line is nicely explained in [Chapter 9](https://happygitwithr.com/push-pull-github.html) and I can't add much to it. Follow the tutorial there, _but don't clean up and remove your repo just yet_(9.6) you may need it in chapter 10, 11 or 12 when you'll want to set up your git not to forget your credentials.

### Setting up credentials and making them permanent
There seem to be two ways to set up your git to avoid having to constantly enter your username and password for GitHub:

- [Chapter 7](https://happygitwithr.com/hello-git.html) with the command line:

```{}
git config --global user.name 'my GitHub username'
git config --global user.email 'my GitHub e-mail'
```

- Or install the `usethis` package (`install.packages('usethis')`) and use the following command: 

```{}
use_git_config(user.name = "My GitHub username", user.email = "My GitHub e-mail")
```

Making those changes permanent can be done with the following command (see [Chapter 10](https://happygitwithr.com/credential-caching.html), for Linux scroll down to **10.5.0.4 Linux**):
```{bash gitconfig&credentialhelper, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
git config --global credential.helper 'cache --timeout=31536000'
```
31536000 seconds is one year, and that seems fine to me

Then test it with:
```{bash gitconfig&test, eval=FALSE, results='hide'}
echo "adding a line" >> README.md
git add -A
git commit -m "A commit from my local computer"
```
And then<br> 
```git push -u origin master```<br>
then, push again, hoping that I wouldn't need to give my username and password...<br>
```git push```<br>

I don't exclude that I might have to follow the guidelines for authentication via SSH as explained [here](https://happygitwithr.com/ssh-keys.html#ssh-keys)).

Also setting up & getting a GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT) is interestingto create a repo directly from RStudio (see [appendix A](https://happygitwithr.com/github-pat.html#github-pat) of the Happy Git with R book). I started at section B.3. Step by Step.
I tried:
```{}
usethis::browse_github_pat()
```
and

Generating a new token by following the link to GitHub: [https://github.com/settings/tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

It's more or less the same, the first option has some checkboxes already filled in for you, and the console reminds you of the following steps:

And nice reminder ::smiley::

## RStudio, GIT & GitHub
On to [Chapter 12](https://happygitwithr.com/rstudio-git-github.html), to try and make everything work from within RStudio...<br>
The first steps are quite easy to do : File > New Project > Version Control > Git<br>
(sidestep, [how to insert images in blog](/post/insert-external-images))
![File > New project](/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/File_new_project.png)
![Version Control](/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/version_control.png)
![Git Project](/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/gitproject.png)
![clone GIT](/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/clonegit.png)

So, now that the repo from GitHub is on the computer, it's time to check if it's possible to make some changes to a file, commit & push it.
Following the workflow in chapter 12.4:

- Add a line to README.md (e.g. "Adding a line from RStudio)
- Click the “Git” tab in upper right pane.
- Check “Staged” box for README.md.
- If you’re not already in the Git pop-up, click “Commit”.
- Type a message in “Commit message”, such as “Commit from RStudio”.
- Click “Commit”
- Now, Push and hope for success (see image below)

A couple of screenshots can help clarifying this:
