Sidestep: Including external images
I need to include some screenshots and this should be easy peasy, but I have spent quite some time wrestling with this. Up untill then I was knitting the posts ```.rmd``` file, to check it's html output. However inserting the image gave me an error ("file not found"). Because I've got this ```.rdm``` file in the website folder as a new post, I don't have to knit it anymore but check the post in my Viewer where it is automatically updated every time I save the file ::smiley::<br>

So, just to show you, **blogdown** comes with addins, and I just had to choose "insert Image" in the addins menu.<br>
It will insert code in the form of:<br>
```![alternative text](path to file, starting from your /static folder)```<br>
**Blogdown** assumes the path is stated from your ```static``` folder
![addin insert image](/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/blogdown_addin_image.png)
Or through Tools > Addins > Browse Addins:<br>

![tools > addins > browse addins](/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/tools_addins*.png){width=70%}
And then click the 'Insert Image' addin:
![Addin Chooser](/post/2020-02-14-getting-rstudio-up-and-running-to-serve-a-website_files/Addins_chooser.png){width=70%}



Another possibility is using knitr's function<br> ```knitr::include_graphics()```<br> 
The basic form would be <br>```knitr::include_graphics(file to path starting from \static\)``` 

I heavily relied on Alison Presmanes Hill's minimal [blogdown website](https://blogdown-demo.rbind.io/2017/10/06/adding-figures-and-other-images-to-posts/), so do check it out for more information !
